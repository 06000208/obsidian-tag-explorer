# Tag Explorer

An [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin which implements an alternative tag pane.

Obsidian's built in tag pane reveals the Search pane to display a list of results using the `tag:` operator, while this plugin's tag explorer will provide a hierarchical tree view of tags and files within the same pane, akin to the file explorer, aiming to make it easier and more seamless to use tags.

⚠️ This is a work in progress, and there are no releases available yet.
